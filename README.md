# SePurity Vendor Risk Management Project

I made this project to simulate a **Third-Party Vendor Risk Management (VRM) assessment** for **SePurity, Inc.**, a fictional SaaS cybersecurity company for the purposes of this project.  
I created it as a self-driven portfolio project to demonstrate my skills and passion in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and to practice documenting realistic vendor risk scenarios.

## Project Background
**SePurity, Inc.** is a cybersecurity SaaS provider serving small and mid-sized businesses.  
The company depends on three vendors to operate:  
- **AWS (Critical Tier):** Hosts the SePurity platform, sensitive customer data, and scan results.  
- **Salesforce (High Tier):** CRM for managing customer accounts, renewals, and support.  
- **Dropbox (Low Tier):** Internal file sharing for training materials, templates, and marketing content.  

This project follows a step-by-step VRM lifecycle, beginning with vendor scoping and tiering, and progressing toward due diligence, control evaluation, and continuous monitoring.

## Visual Overview
The diagram below shows how SePurity employees access AWS, Salesforce, and Dropbox through the company’s Single Sign-On (SSO) provider, and the type of data each vendor handles.

## About This Project
This Vendor Risk Assessment project is part of my cybersecurity and GRC learning journey.  
It demonstrates how Vendor Risk Management can be structured, documented, and communicated in a way that reflects real-world processes.  
I have designed the deliverbales to have transparency, clarity, and to highlight how risks can be identified and presented effectively.
