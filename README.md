# SePurity Vendor Risk Management Project

I made this project to simulate a **Third-Party Vendor Risk Management (VRM) assessment** for **SePurity, Inc.**, a fictional SaaS cybersecurity company for the purposes of this project.  
I created it as a self-driven portfolio project to demonstrate my skills and passion in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and to practice documenting realistic vendor risk scenarios.

## Key Takeaway

Risk management is not about eliminating risk, but about understanding it, reducing it where possible, and living with it responsibly.  
This project demonstrates how I would take a structured, step-by-step approach to managing vendor risks at a growing SaaS company.
