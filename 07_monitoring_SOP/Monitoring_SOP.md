# Monitoring SOP — SePurity, Inc.

This step describes how SePurity will continue to oversee its vendors after the initial assessment.  
The risk register and remediation plan are valuable, but risks do not stay static. The landscape is fluid, as vendors evolve, new subprocessors are added, and regulations shift. Monitoring makes sure SePurity stays ahead of these changes.  

---

## Why Monitoring Matters
- Risks change over time as vendors add new features, services, or subprocessors.  
- Regulations like GDPR and CCPA continue to evolve and may expand.  
- Security certifications expire and need to be renewed.  
- News of breaches can affect vendor trust at any moment.  

Monitoring is what keeps vendor risk management alive. Without it, a risk assessment would just be a snapshot in time.

## Sample Monitoring Workflow

1. Quarterly Vendor Review Meeting  
   - Review the Risk Register and make updates if new risks appear  
   - Confirm remediation tasks are on track  
   - Adjust vendor tiers if necessary  

2. Annual Due Diligence Update  
   - Request updated SOC 2, ISO 27001, and compliance reports from each vendor  
   - Document any vendor responses in the Due Diligence folder  

3. Ongoing Monitoring  
   - Subscribe to vendor Trust Centers (AWS, Salesforce, Dropbox)  
   - Set Google Alerts for vendor names with keywords like “breach” or “security incident”  
   - Track external monitoring services such as BitSight or SecurityScorecard if available

## Key Takeaway

Monitoring is about staying proactive. The goal is not to eliminate risk, but to make sure risks are tracked and addressed as they change.  
By setting clear responsibilities, review cycles, and defined activities, SePurity creates a vendor risk management program that continues over time rather than ending after one assessment.
