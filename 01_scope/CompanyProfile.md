## Regulatory Landscape
SePurity processes customer employee and system data during vulnerability scans and training. It does **not** store highly regulated data (e.g., credit cards, medical records).  

Therefore, SePurity aligns with the following standards and regulations:  
- **SOC 2** — Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)  
- **ISO 27001** — Information Security Management Systems  
- **GDPR** — EU privacy law (due to the UK support team and EU customers)  
- **CCPA** — California Consumer Privacy Act (for California-based customers)  

> **Note:** Vendors handling SePurity’s customer data must also meet similar compliance expectations.
